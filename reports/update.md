# Lisperers Project Update

A Lisp-Based Language in C developed by [Conan McGannon](https://github.com/hyrtzhyro) and [Daniel Park](https://github.com/DanPark13)

Your project update should answer the following questions (note that some are the same as in the proposal):

## 1) What is the goal of your project; for example, what do you plan to make, and what should it do?  Identify a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.

Lisp is a family of programming languages characterised by the fact that all their computation is represented by lists. In this project, we will be developing a minimalistic Lisp-based language with a few core structures and builtins such as variables, functions, and conditional handling. The purpose of this is for us to allow us to understand what goes into making a core language while also having it easy to debug and trim away any waste away if it develops into something bigger than can be used for a large project.

By the end of the project, we should be able to have a functional programming language that can successfully compile and compute simple tasks such as printing, conditional checking, and mathematical equations.

## 2) What are your learning goals; that is, what do you intend to achieve by working on this project?

From this project, we fundamentally want to get a better understanding of the C Programming Language, building a base on top of what we have learned so far in SoftSys. We also want to make decisions based on understanding how a programming language is structured and seek new ways to view computation. Outside of computing, we want to build something that we will be proud of and build our communication skills with each other and build our software development collaboration skills.

## 3) What have you done to get started?  Have you found the resources you need, do you have a plan to find them, or do you need help?  If you found any resources you think I should add to the list on the class web page, please email them to me.

## 4) What are you working on now?  Describe at least three concrete tasks that you are working on, and identify which members of the team are working on them.  For each one, what is the "definition of done"; that is, what will you produce to demonstrate that the task is done?

Audience: Think of your update as a rough draft of your final report.  Target an external audience that wants to know what you did and why.  More specifically, think about students in future versions of SoftSys who might want to work on a related project.  Also think about people who might look at your online portfolio to see what you know, what you can do, and how well you can communicate.
